BACKGROUND: Longitudinal data analysis, which involves repeated observations of individuals, is a valuable source of information, but inaccessible due to data protection laws. Techniques like Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) and Synthetic data generation are essential for safe data use. However, there is a notable gap in available longitudinal data, particularly in fields like health and mobile traffic, where data must often be detailed for meaningful analysis.
