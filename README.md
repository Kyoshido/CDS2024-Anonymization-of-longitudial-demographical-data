In recent years, there has been a growing demand for open science approaches in research, especially for open data. The reproducibility of many studies is limited, and the privacy of respondents is the main reason why many datasets cannot be disseminated.
Current sources dealing with statistical confidentiality of longitudinal data are limited and are in need of more research. 
Many datasets contain demographic variables that require proper protection against disclosure. For example, transportation, health or psychology datasets contain a lot of information that is currently hidden and cannot be easily shared.
To overcome this issue, the approach of statistical disclosure methods with emphasis on the simulation of synthetic data is explored and evaluated. These methods either modify or synthesize data so that it can be disclosed without revealing confidential information that may be associated with specific respondents. A practical application example illustrates the concepts.
